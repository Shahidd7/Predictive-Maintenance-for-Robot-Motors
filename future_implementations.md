## 1. ☁️ Cloud-Based Monitoring & Logging

### What it is
Send all sensor readings and fault events to a cloud platform in real time so they can be accessed from anywhere, not just the local Wi-Fi network.

### Why it is useful
Currently the dashboard only works when you are on the same Wi-Fi network as the robot. Cloud integration removes this limitation and also stores historical data permanently.

### How to implement
- Use platforms like **ThingSpeak**, **Firebase**, or **AWS IoT Core**
- ESP32 sends data via HTTP POST or MQTT protocol to the cloud
- Build a cloud dashboard using **Grafana** or the platform's built-in visualization tools
- Set up automated email or SMS alerts when a fault is logged

### Suggested Tools
`ThingSpeak` `Firebase Realtime Database` `MQTT` `AWS IoT` `Grafana`

## 2. 🔋 Battery Health Monitoring

### What it is
Add a dedicated voltage divider circuit or a fuel gauge IC to monitor the Li-Po battery voltage and estimate remaining charge.

### Why it is useful
A low battery causes the motors to draw inconsistent current, which directly affects baseline accuracy and can trigger false fault detections. Knowing battery level in advance prevents this.

### How to implement
- Use a simple **voltage divider** (two resistors) connected to an ESP32 ADC pin to read battery voltage
- Map the voltage to a percentage (e.g. 8.4V = 100%, 6.6V = 0% for a 2S Li-Po)
- Display battery percentage on the web dashboard
- Trigger a warning when battery drops below 20%
- Optionally use the **MAX17043** fuel gauge IC for more accurate readings

### Suggested Tools
`Voltage Divider Circuit` `MAX17043 IC` `ESP32 ADC`

## 3. 🔔 Buzzer-Based Alert System

### What it is
Add a piezo buzzer to the robot that beeps at different patterns based on the fault state.

### Why it is useful
The web dashboard requires someone to actively be watching it. A buzzer gives immediate physical feedback even when no one is monitoring the screen — especially useful in noisy or remote environments.

### How to implement
- Connect a piezo buzzer to any available GPIO pin on the ESP32
- Define beep patterns for each state:
  - 1 short beep → WARNING
  - 2 short beeps → FAULT DETECTED
  - Continuous rapid beeps → CRITICAL FAULT
- Use `tone()` or PWM to control beep frequency

### Suggested Tools
`Piezo Buzzer` `ESP32 PWM` `GPIO Output`

## 4. 📱 Mobile App Integration

### What it is
Build a dedicated mobile app for Android or iOS that connects to the robot and displays the dashboard instead of using a browser.

### Why it is useful
A native app provides push notifications, a better mobile UI, and can work even when the browser tab is closed. It also allows background monitoring.

### How to implement
- Use **MIT App Inventor** for a quick no-code Android app
- Or build with **Flutter** for a cross-platform (Android + iOS) app
- Connect the app to the ESP32 using WebSockets or HTTP requests
- Add push notifications using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** when a fault is detected

### Suggested Tools
`Flutter` `MIT App Inventor` `WebSockets` `Firebase FCM`

## 5. 🖥️ OLED Display on Robot

### What it is
Mount a small OLED screen directly on the robot to show live sensor data and fault status without needing to open the dashboard.

### Why it is useful
Gives instant on-device feedback during testing or demos without needing a phone or laptop. Very useful when debugging in the field.

### How to implement
- Use a **0.96 inch SSD1306 OLED** module (I2C, same bus as MPU6050)
- Display current state, fault score, and motor status on screen
- Scroll through sensor values every few seconds
- Show a simple icon or symbol for each fault type

### Suggested Tools
`SSD1306 OLED` `Adafruit SSD1306 Library` `I2C`

## 6. 📷 Camera-Based Visual Fault Detection

### What it is
Add a camera module to the robot to visually inspect its surroundings and detect physical faults like loose wires, smoke, or obstacles.

### Why it is useful
Sensor data alone cannot detect everything. A camera adds a visual layer of fault detection and also enables remote visual inspection via the dashboard.

### How to implement
- Use the **ESP32-CAM** module (has a built-in camera)
- Stream live video to the web dashboard
- Use basic image processing to detect smoke or unusual color changes
- For advanced use, run a lightweight object detection model using **TensorFlow Lite**

### Suggested Tools
`ESP32-CAM` `TensorFlow Lite` `OpenCV` `MJPEG Streaming`
