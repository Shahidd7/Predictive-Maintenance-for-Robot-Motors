## 📌 Introduction

This project presents a real-time predictive maintenance system implemented on a 2WD mobile robot using an ESP32 microcontroller. The objective is to detect motor faults reliably under real-world conditions **without relying on static datasets or pre-trained machine learning models**.

The system continuously monitors motor behavior using multiple sensors and identifies anomalies by comparing real-time data against a dynamically learned baseline. Based on the severity of detected deviations, the system automatically adjusts motor operation to prevent damage.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Initial attempts focused on building a machine learning model using collected datasets under three operating conditions:

- Normal
- Moving
- Blocked

While this approach worked in controlled conditions, it failed during repeated real-world testing. The primary issue observed was **sensor drift**, especially in current readings. The same motor produced different values across sessions due to variations in battery voltage, load conditions, and environmental factors.

This made the prebuilt dataset unreliable, as the trained model could not generalize to new conditions.

---

## 🔄 Key Design Shift

To overcome these limitations, the approach was redesigned.

Instead of training a model on fixed data, the system now:

- ✅ Learns its own "normal" behavior **at runtime**
- ✅ Uses **statistical methods** to detect deviations
- ✅ Eliminates dependency on pre-collected datasets

> The prebuilt dataset was not discarded entirely — it was used to understand the approximate operating range of sensor values. However, it is **not used for real-time decision-making**.

## 🛠️ Development Process

### Step 1 — Basic Robot Implementation
A differential drive 2WD robot was built and controlled using the ESP32. Initial validation ensured stable motor control, proper power distribution, and reliable communication.

### Step 2 — Current Monitoring
The ACS712 current sensor was integrated to measure motor load. Data collection revealed that current values varied significantly between runs, even under similar conditions.

### Step 3 — Machine Learning Attempt
A dataset was created using different operating states and used to train a model. However, due to inconsistent sensor behavior, the model failed to provide reliable predictions.

> This step was critical in identifying the limitations of static ML approaches in embedded systems with variable hardware conditions.

### Step 4 — Multi-Sensor Integration
To improve reliability, additional sensors were introduced: MPU6050 for vibration analysis and DHT11 for temperature monitoring. This enabled a multi-dimensional understanding of motor health.

### Step 5 — Adaptive Baseline Implementation
A warmup phase was introduced at system startup. During this phase, the robot operates under assumed normal conditions and collects sensor data. From this data, the system computes the **mean** (average value) and **standard deviation** (natural variation). This baseline represents the normal operating condition for that specific session and remains fixed during operation.

---

## ⚙️ Core Detection Method

### Z-Score Based Anomaly Detection

The system uses statistical normalization to evaluate deviations:

```
Z = (current_value - baseline_mean) / baseline_std_dev
```

- Small Z values → normal operation
- Large Z values → potential fault
- Both positive and negative deviations are meaningful for current analysis

---

## 🔇 Noise Reduction Techniques

Raw sensor data contains noise that can lead to false detections. Two filtering techniques are used:

- **Median Filter** *(Vibration)* — Removes sudden spikes effectively
- **Moving Average** *(Current)* — Smooths short-term fluctuations

These filters ensure that only consistent anomalies are considered.

---

## 📊 Fault Scoring Mechanism

A unified fault score is computed using weighted contributions from sensors:

```
fault_score = (Z_current × 0.5) + (Z_vibration × 0.5)
```

Additional adjustments:
- Multi-sensor anomalies increase confidence
- Sudden spikes are given extra weight

This scoring system allows **gradual classification** of system health instead of binary decisions.

---

## 🔁 State Machine for Decision Making

To avoid false positives, the system uses a state machine with persistence logic.

```
WARMUP → NORMAL → WARNING → FAULT → CRITICAL
```

A fault is only confirmed if abnormal readings **persist across multiple cycles**. Similarly, recovery requires sustained normal behavior. This ensures stability and prevents reactions to transient noise.

### 📤 Uploading the Code

**Step 1** — Clone or download this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

**Step 2** — Open `working_code.ino` in Arduino IDE.
[code file](working_code.ino).it is the final code for the prototype.

---

### ⏱️ Understanding the Warmup Phase

The warmup phase is **critical** to the system working correctly.

- Runs automatically for the first few seconds after boot
- The robot moves under **normal load conditions** during this time
- The system computes the **mean and standard deviation** for current and vibration as the session baseline

> ⚠️ **Do not block the wheels, apply extra load, or disturb the robot during warmup.** Any abnormal condition will skew the baseline and cause false detections for the entire session.

> 💡 If warmup was disrupted, press the **EN/RST button** to restart a fresh warmup.

### 📊 Reading the Dashboard

| Display Element | What It Means |
|---|---|
| Current (A) | Live motor current draw |
| Vibration Level | MPU6050 vibration intensity |
| Temperature (°C) | DHT11 ambient reading |
| Humidity level | DHT11 humidity reading |
| Fault Score | Weighted anomaly score (0 = normal) |
| System State | WARMUP / NORMAL / WARNING / FAULT / CRITICAL |
| Motor Status | Running / Slowed Down / Stopped |

**System State Meanings:**
- 🟢 **NORMAL** — All readings within baseline range. Motors at full speed.
- 🟡 **WARNING** — Minor deviation detected. System monitoring closely.
- 🟠 **FAULT DETECTED** — Significant anomaly confirmed. Motors automatically slow down.
- 🔴 **CRITICAL FAULT** — Sudden spike detected. Motors halted immediately.
- ⛔ **MOTORS MANUALLY STOPPED** — User stopped motors via dashboard.

---

### 🧪 Testing Fault Detection

**Test 1 — Fault Detection (Motor Slowdown)**
Gently press down on the chassis to increase wheel load. Expect: current rise → fault score increase → **FAULT** state → motors slow down.

**Test 2 — Critical Fault (Sudden Spike)**
Abruptly block both wheels for 1–2 seconds. Expect: sudden spike in current and vibration → **CRITICAL** state → motors stop.

**Test 3 — Manual Stop**
Click **Stop Motors** on the dashboard during any fault. Expect: motors stop immediately, dashboard shows **MOTORS MANUALLY STOPPED**.

**Test 4 — Recovery**
Release all load and let the robot run freely. After sustained normal readings, the system transitions back to **NORMAL** state.

### 📌 Important Notes & Tips

- 🔁 **Always reset before a new session.** The baseline is session-specific and does not persist after power off.
- 🔋 **Monitor battery voltage.** A low battery causes inconsistent current readings and false detections.
- 🌡️ **DHT11 has a 1–2 second response delay.** It is used for long-term trend monitoring only.
- ⚡ **Never connect the Li-Po battery in reverse polarity.**
- 🧰 **Verify buck converter output is exactly 5V** with a multimeter before connecting to the ESP32.
- 💾 **Do not modify the baseline computation** section unless you fully understand the implications.
